What I have done :

Before I started coding the program, I first made a diagram to optimize my classes and methods.
There are therefore 4 classes which are:
- Login
- Customer
- Account
- SavingCurrentAccount

In the login, we therefore find the interface.
For the "Customer" class the method allowing to obtain its account numbe.
And finally the "Savingcurrentaccount" class which makes it possible to inherit methods from the Account class.


What I have completed :

I have more or less completed everything.
I managed to make files and especially to manipulate them by adding and removing customers 
but also modulating the balance of customer accounts ...
I was able to learn new methods like the one allowing to retrieve the last line of a file.

What I could not do :

I have not done a Try catch in the "Login" for all the times when I ask for the last name,
first name, type of account for aesthetic reasons and lines of code.
